An AI (just some if, not a real AI...) for the mod "Loader AI" https://github.com/ebe1kenobi/tf-mod-fortrise-loader-ai.

You can try to play with this IA; it is much better and human like than simple ai or AI python. I think one human against two is better because the IA has still some problem (grab ledge bloc, or loop on some movement, stay still when at the edge of a bloc above an empty bloc)

The IA is for versus play, it can play the coop but it is not very good.

* WiderSetMod supported

**requirements**: mod "Loader AI" https://github.com/ebe1kenobi/tf-mod-fortrise-loader-ai
